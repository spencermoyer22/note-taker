# Note Taker

## Description
This application allows the user to write and save notes. By clicking the new note icon in the upper right, the template for a note title and note text is displayed. Once the user inputs a note title and note text a save icon appears in the upper right. By clicking on the icon the note is saved to website. I was responsible for tying the front end to the back end using Express.js to create api routes. The application works by using different api methods to save, and get the list of notes from a JSON file.
